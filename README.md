# Bourbon -  Tutorial

Bourbon is a top-notch Sass mixin library for designers. It has a minimalistic approach and is serious about creating quality code that cares about semantics. The Bourbon library also encourages best practices for developing scalable code. This tutorial will give me a brief exercise in how to work with Bourbon and its suit of frameworks.

## Items to be covered in this tutorial

* [Bourbon][bourbon]: provides a small but juicy set of mixins and functions that have been extracted from various designersâ€™ Sass code. The idea was to centralize useful mixins and to avoid reinventing the wheel all the time.

* [Neat][neat]: a lightweight grid framework for Sass. It is built on top of Bourbon and was motivated by the need for a semantic approach to layout sites.

* [Refills][refills]: a collection of design patterns, nicely styled or unstyled. They are also designed with Bourbon and Neat. Super useful code examples are at your disposal.

* [Bitters][bitters]: a few scaffold styles, variables and a bit of structure for new Bourbon projects. They get you up and running in no time.
